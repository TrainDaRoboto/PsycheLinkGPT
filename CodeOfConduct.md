**Code of Conduct**__
**1. Purpose**
The primary goal of the PsycheLinkGPT project is to create an inclusive, friendly, and welcoming environment for everyone, regardless of their background or experience. As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to treat all individuals with respect and dignity.

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all contributors and participants within the PsycheLinkGPT community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

**2. Open Source Citizenship**
A supplemental goal of this Code of Conduct is to increase open source citizenship by encouraging participants to recognize and strengthen the relationships between our actions and their effects on our community.

Communities mirror the societies in which they exist, and positive action is essential to counteract the many forms of inequality and abuses of power that exist in society.
